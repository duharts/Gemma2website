# Section 3: Training Google Gemma 2
st.header("Training Google Gemma 2 on Cleaned Data")
st.write("""
    Once the data is cleansed across multiple cloud platforms, Systems Enterprises uses Google Cloudâ€™s Vertex AI and TensorFlow to
    train **Google Gemma 2**, a highly advanced AI language model. By training on diverse datasets, Gemma 2 becomes capable of 
    understanding and generating content that is more inclusive and diverse.
    
    The training process includes:
    - Uploading the cleansed data to **Google Cloud Storage**.
    - Using **Vertex AI** to initiate training with TensorFlow.
    - Fine-tuning the model using **LoRA** (Low-Rank Adaptation) techniques to handle large datasets efficiently.
